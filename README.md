# Learning GitHub
### About GitHub 
> GitHub is a place where developers store their code and multiple versions of their code in a repository (like this one). This allows developers to go back to old versions and have a backup of their code on the cloud. GitHub also has a social aspect, developers can share their code with others and can contribute to projects they like. This helps build their GitHub profile which acts like a resume of sorts, where they can show off projects and contributions to other people’s work. A lot of the world’s code is stored on GitHub including the browser you are most likely using, Chrome. It’s source code called the Chromium project, is stored on GitHub and is accessible by anyone. 

## About Git
> Git is an open source version control tool. It allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. It’s designed for developers, whether it be large teams or just 1 person, to back up, and coordinate work. It’s a very powerful tool and is used literally everywhere there is code, including at companies such as Google, Linux, Microsoft, etc. 

## GitHub vs Git
> Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Don’t use them interchangeably. One is a version control software (Git), the other is a place where you code is stored (Github).

## Terms You'll Need To Know
* **Repo**: Repositories where your code and its versions are stored. 
* **Commits**: Various saves or snapshots of your code.
* **HEAD**: A pointer, you can change its position between commits or branches using the “git checkout” command. 
* **Gitignore**: A git file where you declare files you don’t want to track changes of. Example files: compiled or built files. 
* **README.md**: A file that describes your repository (like this file), styled using the markdown language. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

**cd.. : Navigate to the parent directory relative to working directory. (Go back a folder)**

`cd ..`

**dir (directory): View files and folders in your working directory.**

`dir` 

**mkdir (make directory):  Create a new folder as a child of your working directory.**

`mkdir [folder name here]`

**del: Deletes a file or a folder *contents*.**

`del [file or folder name here]`

**rmdir: Deletes a folder.**

`rmdir [folder name here]`

**explorer . : Opens working directory in file explorer.**
